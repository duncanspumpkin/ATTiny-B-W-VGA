The main aim of this project is to produce a black and white VGA output for the ATTiny45.

The output will be a clock counting down. The count down will be controlled by the left over I/O line for the device.

Pin Out is shown below.

      RESET --|  |-- VCC
      CLK I --|  |-- PB2--BW
COMS--PB4   --|  |-- PB1--HSync
      GND   --|  |-- PB0--VSync

Clock input will be from a oscillator. Alternativly may explore having a crystal this will have to involve changing the RESET into an I/O line. This is not prefered as it makes programming marginally annoying so will be left untill the main project is working.

The program will work as follows. An interrupt will be fired every time a new horizontal line is required. This will output a line of the display. As there are space concerns numbers will be saved in program memory such that 5 numbers side by side takes up the whole display. Since a horizontal line is 636 pixels in length each number will be roughly 127 pixels wide by 480 pixels.
